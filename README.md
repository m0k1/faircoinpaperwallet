FairCoin Paper Wallet
------
Universal Client-Side (js) Wallet Generator fork of [WalletGenerator.net](https://github.com/MichaelMure/WalletGenerator.net/).

Now FairCoin wallets addresses and their corresponding private key can be conveniently generated in a web browser.
The project provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded JavaScript/CSS/Images.  
The JavaScript is readable, not minified and contains no XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX).  
The benefit of this technique is you can load the JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being loaded.

Please send DONATIONS for this project using the crypto-currency addresses available on the 'Donate' tab of the website.

END USER NOTES:
 1) To print QRCode in IE8 you must enable the "Print Background Colors and Images" checkbox on the "Page Setup" screen.
 2) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.
 3) Requires IE8+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.
 4) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.
 5) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, thereforethey might record the private key you generated.
 6) Art Wallet does not work properly in IE8 due to CSS limitations.
